NUMERAI DATA TOURNAMENT
This was a project I started back in June 2019, when I first learned Python. I became interested in this project when I came across the Numerai Data tournament. Something different after years of trading XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin.
The concept of the tournament was very intriguing, due to the aspect of predictions of markets, with the usage of past market data sets.

Tensor results would be generated by utilizing modules numpy, pandas, and pytorch in a vast array of forms. Predictions would the be sent to Numerai, and correct predicitons would allocate additonal coins based on amount staked at time of submission. Incorrect predictions would burn a portion of the staked currency based on algorithm developed.
I have used many forms of submission methods from Python scripts to cloud based submission methods using AWS S3 instances for automation.

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Pytorch
- AWS (S3)
- XrbReggressor
- Numerai API
- Dask
